# DriveTRACE
**Traffic Replication And Control Environment**
<br>
A real-world traffic simulation to replicate traffic flow from actual routes, providing a learning environment and constant feedback.

<br>

# Overview
**DriveTRACE** is a real world traffic simulation system designed to help beginner drivers safely practice driving in a realistic, natural traffic flow. The system uses computer vision techniques to classify, detect, and trace vehicle paths from highway footage over a period of time. These vehicle patterns are replicated in a simulation environment, complete with real-time feedback on driving behaviour of the user.
<br>
The platform aims to provide a risk-free, but realistic experience with local traffic. Having the freedom to simulate driving on various times and days, equips them with enough confidence to drive safely.

# Features
- **Real-time vehicle detection and classification** using YOLO and OpenCV
- **Trajectory tracing and speed mapping** to obtain data on traffic behaviour
- **3D simulated environment** with realistic roads, vehicle models, and exact traffic activity
- **Variety of times, locations, and days** the user can choose to practice on
- **Bad driving behaviour detection, and traffic laws detection** using real-world speed limits and laws, along with feedback on discouraged driving habits
